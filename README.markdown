# Little Sage Chatbot

A simple Python chatbot with a tsundere personality – grumpy but secretly helpful. This project was created as a personal exercise to practice Python basics (loops, dictionaries, functions) and add some fun to coding.

## Overview

This chatbot responds to basic user inputs with a mix of sass and reluctant assistance. It includes triggers for greetings, farewells, help requests, and even some bad jokes. The code was initially written in Portuguese, but the base has been translated to English using GPT (Im a lazy man) for better accessibility on GitHub.

## Features

- Responds to common phrases like "hi," "help," "bye," and more.
- Tsundere personality with grumpy yet caring replies (e.g., "Hmph, don't waste my time.").
- Random response selection for variety.
- Graceful exit on farewell messages.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
2. Clone this repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Yllodido3d/little-sage-agent.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project folder and run the script:

   ```
   python chatbotsábio.py
   ```
4. Start chatting! Type messages and see the chatbot's responses.

## Code Details

- The dictionary of responses was crafted by Grok (xAI), adding a tsundere flair to keep things interesting.
- Uses `random.choice()` for dynamic replies and a simple loop to handle user input.
- No external dependencies – pure Python!

## Future Improvements

- Add more response categories.
- Implement file storage for custom user inputs.
- Maybe make it less grumpy... but don’t count on it.
